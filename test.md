Chess is perhaps the world's first global mega-hit, having migrated from East to West over the course of centuries. And we can easily track how the design and rules of the "immortal game" have evolved and shifted over time. Many people would be surprised to find out that some of chess' most iconic rules-- such as the Queen's dominance of the board-- developed at particular times and places. Chess has also been a fount of potent metaphors about society, emphasizing specific themes at specific times.
